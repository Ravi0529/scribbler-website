## What is Scribble Pad?

Scribble Pad is a unique opportunity for students to dive deep into JavaScript programming through an engaging and collaborative hackathon. Over the course of the hackathon, participants will work in teams of 2-3 to develop a JavaScript notebook using Scribbler, tackling projects in any of the following areas:

- **Machine Learning/AI/Gen AI:** Explore the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning by building models, experimenting with algorithms, or creating generative AI applications.
- **XR (Extended Reality):** Develop immersive experiences in virtual or augmented reality, pushing the boundaries of interactive content.
- **Gaming:** Create innovative games in the browser involve various input methods including key board, camera, voice controls etc.

## Why Participate in Scribble Pad?

**1. Hands-On JavaScript Experience:**
   - Participants will gain practical experience by coding in JavaScript and working on real-world projects. This hands-on approach will help deepen their understanding of JavaScript and its applications.

**2. Demoable Notebooks:**
   - Each team will create a Scribbler notebook that can be showcased as part of their portfolio. These notebooks are valuable assets for post-graduate programs or job applications, demonstrating a candidate's ability to apply technical skills to solve problems.

**3. Participation Certifications:**
   - Every team that submits a working project will receive a participation certificate, recognizing their effort and achievement. These certificates can be added to resumes or LinkedIn profiles as a mark of technical proficiency.

**4. Prizes for Top Teams:**
   - The top three teams will be awarded exciting prizes, acknowledging their creativity, technical skill, and innovation. Winning teams will also have the opportunity to present their projects during the awards ceremony on the 10th of November.

## How to Get Involved

1. **Virtual Workshop on 7th November:**
   - The hackathon will kick off with a virtual workshop on JavaScript. This session will provide an introduction to Scribbler, cover essential JavaScript concepts, and offer tips for building successful projects. It’s a great opportunity for participants to brush up on their skills and prepare for the challenge ahead.

2. **Team Formation on 7th November:**
   - After the workshop, students will have the chance to form teams of 2-3 people. This is the time to connect with peers, brainstorm ideas, and start planning your project.

3. **Submission on 10th November:**
   - Teams will have until the 10th of November to complete their projects and submit their Scribbler notebooks. This deadline ensures that all participants have ample time to develop their ideas, code, and refine their submissions.

4. **Demo Day and Awards on 10th November:**
   - The hackathon will culminate in a demo day on the 10th of November, where teams will present their projects to a panel of judges. The best projects will be recognized and awarded prizes in an awards ceremony following the demos.
