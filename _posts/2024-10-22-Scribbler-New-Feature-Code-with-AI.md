## Power of AI for Coding
We’re excited to announce a powerful new feature in Scribbler, the JavaScript notebook, that leverages AI to help you write better code right within your browser! Scribbler now integrates with WebLLM, allowing you to run AI models locally without subscriptions or cloud costs, using open-source models. Here’s everything you need to know about this game-changing addition.

### What is WebLLM
[WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai/) enables running language models directly in your browser, thanks to modern hardware acceleration. Scribbler’s AI assistant uses these models to provide coding suggestions, refactor code, or even generate snippets based on prompts—all on your device.

### No Subscriptions, No Cloud—It’s Open-Source and Local
One of the standout aspects of this feature is that it doesn’t require any paid subscription or remote server processing. Everything happens on your local machine. The models, being open-source, are loaded directly onto your device. That means your data stays private and local.

## What You Need to Get Started
GPU-Enabled Device: Since model inference requires processing power, a GPU is necessary to run these models efficiently.
GPU-Enabled Browser: Make sure your browser supports GPU acceleration (modern browsers like Chrome or Firefox will suffice).

### How to Use Scribbler’s AI
Here’s how you can start using AI to boost your coding productivity:

- Click "AI" in the Menu: Once you’re in Scribbler, you’ll see an "AI" option in the top menu. Click on it to access the AI assistant.
- Choose a Model: Depending on your device’s capabilities, you can choose from a range of models. If you’re unsure whether your GPU can handle larger models, start with the smallest model.
- Pro Tip: The first load will take a little time as the model downloads, but subsequent uses will be much faster.
- Invoke AI in Code Cells: To use the AI, type //> followed by your prompt in a code cell, and then run the cell. Watch as the AI provides suggestions or even generates full code snippets based on your input.

## Why This is a Game-Changer
- Local Processing: All AI computations happen on your device, ensuring both privacy and performance.
- Quick Prototyping: By using //>, you can quickly get code suggestions and experiment with new ideas.
- Accessibility: You don’t need to sign up for expensive subscriptions or set up external environments—everything runs in your browser.

### Example Usage
Say you’re writing a function in JavaScript but are unsure how to structure it. Simply add a cell with a prompt like this:

```javascript
//> Write a function to calculate factorial of a number
```

Run the cell, and Scribbler’s AI will generate the code for you, like magic! You can tweak the prompt for more specific requests, and the AI adapts to your needs.

## Conclusion
With the new AI feature in Scribbler powered by WebLLM, coding is about to get a whole lot smarter. It’s easy, private, and designed to fit seamlessly into your workflow. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, the AI assistant can save time, enhance creativity, and provide insights to help you build faster and more efficiently.
