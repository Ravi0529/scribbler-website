Scribbler is a powerful JavaScript notebook tool and online comilerthat allows you to create, collaborate, and publish interactive applications. With its intuitive interface and AI-powered coding features, Scribbler makes it easy to build and share awesome notebooks. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps to publish your Scribbler notebook and share it with the world.

## Step 1: Build an Awesome Notebook

To get started, head over to [app.scribbler.live](https://app.scribbler.live) and create a new notebook. Use the AI feature to code fast and efficiently. Scribbler's AI-powered coding assistant can help you write code, debug errors, and even suggest improvements. Take advantage of this feature to build an awesome notebook that showcases your creativity and skills.

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

Once you've built your notebook, it's time to push it to GitHub. To do this, go to File > Git and follow the prompts to connect your GitHub account. You'll need to enter your GitHub token, which can be obtained from your GitHub settings. This will link your Scribbler notebook to your GitHub repository, allowing you to version control and collaborate with others.

## Step 3: Get Published Links

Now that your notebook is connected to GitHub, click on the Publish button at the top menu. This will generate three published links:

1. Notebook Link: This link allows you to continue editing and updating your notebook. Share this link with collaborators or use it to make further changes to your code.
2. Published App Link: This link can be used directly as an application in the browser. Share this link with others to showcase your interactive application. Note: This will not give access to secured features like cookies, camera etc. For accessing those you will have to embed the notebook in another html page as an iframe using the embedding code in the next point.
3. Code Snippet for Embedding: This code snippet can be used to embed your notebook as an iframe in other applications. Simply copy and paste the code into your desired platform to share your interactive content. Build any static html page and embed the notebook inside the html page.
